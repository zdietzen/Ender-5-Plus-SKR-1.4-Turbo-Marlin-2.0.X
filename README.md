# Ender-5-Plus-SKR-1.4-Turbo-Marlin-2.0.X
Compiled firmware for Creality Ender 5 Plus with Big Tree Tech SKR 1.4 Turbo Marlin 2.0.7 

When wiring the BLTouch, I installed on the Z-Stop pins and not the dedicated pins the 1.4 has for the BLTouch. I did this becuase some online guides did it that way. This may be the cause of the issue.

BLTouch is currently not working! BLT will test, retract, and extend from display but will not stop z-axis when triggered. Troubleshooting the issue currently.

When BLT is triggered z-axis does not stop causing the bed to crash into the hotend.
